## 📌 1️⃣ What is Queue<String>?

Queue is an interface from the package:

java.util.Queue

It defines the behavior of a queue (FIFO — First In, First Out).

When you write:

Queue<String>
You are saying:

I want to work with the contract of a queue that stores Strings.

You are programming against the interface, not against the implementation.

This is good design practice.
